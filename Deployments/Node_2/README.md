# Node_2 Application

This deployment was auto-generated by the F' utility tool.

## Building and Running the Node_2 Application

In order to build the Node_2 application, or any other FÂ´ application, we first need to generate a build directory. This can be done with the following commands:

```
cd Node_2
fprime-util generate
```

The next step is to build the Node_2 application's code.
```
fprime-util build
```

## Running the application and F' GDS

The following command will spin up the F' GDS as well as run the application binary and the components necessary for the GDS and application to communicate.

```
cd Node_2
fprime-gds
```

To run the ground system without starting the Node_2 app:
```
cd Node_2
fprime-gds --no-app
```

The application binary may then be run independently from the created 'bin' directory.

```
cd Node_2/build-artifacts/<platform>/bin/
./Node_2 -a 127.0.0.1 -p 50000
```
